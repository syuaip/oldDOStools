0.INtROdUCTiON

  Welcome to WAV2com !

  We are convinced many of you (usr) are familiar with some famous games,
  like Prince_of_Persia(1990), or One_Must_Fall(1994).
  What do you think about their on-line music ? Pretty neat Ha ?!

  Every body loves to hear sound or music. Right ? (no_need_to_answer!)
  And with technology existing today, you can have a sound card
  which can bring more "life-like" to your PC.
  Well... If you dont have a sound-card, your PC cant give you
  a sophisticated instrumental music. But dont hide your face behind
  your monitor then. You still can have a scream out of your PC,
  using its internal speaker. How ? Using your MS-Windows' .WAV files!


1.WhAT iS WAv2CoM

  WAV2com is a file-converter, converting a file with a .WAV or .SND format,
  a file which contain digitized analog sound data to be a .COM file format,
  a type of file which you can load directly from DOS.


2.HoW tO USe WAV2cOm

  a. load Wav2COM.exe by typing

     WAV2COM<enter>

  b. type filename of .WAV you would like to convert

     Filename [.WAV]         : sample1_<enter>

     If you don't give the filename an extension,
     then .WAV extension will be given.
     The size of input file must not be greater than 64975 bytes.
     Different drive and path names are acceptable in this dialog.

  c. type filename of .COM to be created

     Filename [sample1.COM]  : _

     If you don't give a filename in this dialog then WAV2com will
     assumed that you received the suggested output filename in the
     bracket. However, if you would like to change filename, just
     type in the name you desired. And still, if don't give the
     filename a extension, .COM extension will be given.
     Different drive and path names are also acceptable in this dialog.

  d. wait for WAV2com accomplishing its job

     transferring sample1.WAV to sample1.COM [34291 bytes]... ( 34%)

     Just wait until the percentage counter on right side reach 100%.
     After that, unless an unexpected error occur, sample1.COM
     will be created and ready to run.


3.sYStEM rEQUiREMeNTS

  To be able to run properly, WAV2com needs an IBM PC, PC/XT,
  PC/AT or PS/2, and the compatible of them, which are based
  on 80x86 system. Most of PC built today has an internal timer
  and a PC internal speaker. So unless your PC is made out of stone
  (like the one Mr.Flinstones has), you must have no problem.
  640Kb of attached memory, with at least 64 KB available.
  And MSDOS or PCDOS Version 3.0 or later.

4.COmmUNIcAtIOn WIth DOS

  WAV2com can tell DOS, wether converting job was taken correctly or not.

  These are ERRORLEVEL codes passed from WAV2com to DOS :
  _________________________________________________________________________

  Success                   0  Convertion works fine and no error occured

  Checksum error            1  WAV2com find an error on WAV2com.Exe file.
                               .COM file creation will be aborted.
                               Because if .COM file still be created,
                               when it run, it can lead to a system crash.

  Cancelled by usr          2  User cancelled the convertion by giving
                               no filename to be processed.

  File not found            4  WAV. file as the input file can not be found.

  WAV file access error     8  WAV. file was founded, but can not be opened.

  File too big             16  WAV. file is bigger than 64975 bytes, so it
                               couldn't be processed. The maximum size of
                               any .COM file is 64kb, which is the size of
                               one RAM segment. If the file is processed,
                               the .COM would be too big to fit in one
                               segment.

  COM file access error    32  Can not open a new .COM file. This could
                               happen sometimes. i.e. if your directory
                               is full or your disk is write protected.

  File process error       64  There is a error occuring during the conversion
                               time. .COM can still be created, because it
                               will be closed before WAV2com return to DOS.

  File closing error      128  This error raise when WAV2com found some
                               failures in closing the .COM file.
                               .COM file may not be complete, but ussualy
                               it still can be executed.
  _________________________________________________________________________


5.BUGS AND DRAWBACKS
  Well.. we all know that nothing is perfect. We have tested
  WAV2com to be ran at as many system as possible. And we
  have found some noticable things.
  a. .COM files which made by WAV2com are seldom compressable by
     ICE COMcompressor or COMtoEXE-LZEXE. We've tried to compress
     output file in such methods, but the result is unpredictable.
     Sometimes (many times) when we ran the compressed file,
     the system become freeze. And even if it is not, and the compression
     became successfull, the compression rate often more than 10%.
     This maybe because the complexity of data stream on .WAV file.
  b. We have made WAV2com as mobile and downward-compatible as it can be.
     We have substitute some 80286-above machine code with 8086/8088 code.
     But we cannot guarantee that it will work properly on every PCs or XTs.
     The best way to find out is try it on the system it self.

WAV2com was written in Turbo Pascal 5.5 and Turbo Assembler 1.0.
The average processing rate is now about 20 kbytes/sec (on harddisk).
We're now in progress on rewriting WAV2com to speed up the
processing rate, also support parameters and be able to access AdLib,
SoundBlaster Cards and their compatibles.
